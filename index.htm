        <h1>We Challenge you to Learn.</h1>
        <p>instruqt is a learning platform where you can compete in competitions consisting of challenges that gain you experience in a fun and hands-on way.</p>
        <p>By moving to a gamified way of learning, you can learn more efficiently and simulate real life scenarios repeatedly.</p>

    <section id="why">
      <div class="content">



        <blockquote><img src="img/instruqt-wip.png" />You deserve a better way to learn.</blockquote>

        <p>For organizations that want to remain flexible, responsive and competitive in today’s continuously fluctuating marketplace, knowledge is not only power; it's a priority.</p>
        <p>Organizations need to continually refresh and refortify their established experts and nurture the growth of new ones, by committing to ongoing training programs.</p>

        <p>But with the amount of tools available to engineers growing at an ever increasing pace, it is impossible to keep up with these changes. Adopting new tools, the underlying concepts and best practices require a big investment in time and effort. How do you select the right tool? And what if you choose the wrong one?</p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section id="learning">
      <div class="content">
        <h1>Status quo of learning</h1>
        <p>The current style of selecting and learning tools does not match this increased pace and diversity. Let’s review how you currently learn new technologies and their concepts.</p>

        <h3>Documentation crawl</h3>
        <p>Documentation is a very important source of information. You start out by crawling the website, and, if you are lucky, it does not only consist of marketing information, and you get a good sense of what the tool can solve for you. But reading documentation without context or knowing what you are looking for can be very time consuming.</p>
        <p>When confronted with an undocumented feature, you might have to resort to reading the source code instead. After finishing the getting started and you have something up and running, you start to feel pretty good about yourself. But you have no idea what you just did or how it works. After some more reading you think you understand the basics.</p>

        <h3>Traditional training days</h3>
        <p>To actually start mastering a tool you go to a few training days and workshops. Most training sessions are linear show-and-tell presentations, with a follow-by-example workshop that focuses on theory and straight-forward, getting started use-cases. At the end, you are filled with questions with respect to your actual real-world problems as time with the trainer is too short. Your question might not fit the mold of the selected problem cases in the prepared standardized global training curriculum. Often the trainer doesn’t even have real-world experience using the tool.</p>

        <h3>Hear from the community and thought leaders</h3>
        <p>To learn from others and get to know some of the best practises, you go to some meetups and conferences. There you can hear how the community and thought leaders are using new tooling. Most of the time they only tell you the getting-started-manual you already read.</p>

        <h3>Not fit for purpose</h3>
        <p>These traditional methods are not efficient nor effective, and scale badly if we need to learn every tool this way. And you won’t know if the tool you are learning is a great fit until you have already heavily invested in it.</p>
        <p>So really, only hands-on experience and real-life usage will teach you the ins and outs of the tool. You deserve a better way to learn.</p>

    <section id="gamification">
      <div class="content">
        <h1>Gamifying the learning experience</h1>
        <p>The last few years, gamification has been mentioned in trend reports as an up and coming methodology by companies such as Gartner. While some sectors within IT have already adopted it heavily to improve their learning methods, it has not been applied to subjects such as infrastructure automation and DevOps.</p>
        <p>Tools are used to solve problems, and problems are effectively challenges in disguise. Humans are uniquely geared towards solving challenges and being rewarded for the effort. Gamification offers an effective yet fun way to learn.</p>

        <h3>Guided path to learning</h3>
        <p>It enables a guided path to learning, by breaking problems down into bite-sized challenges, and forming skill trees with ascending difficulty or complexity. Learn how to solve problems, and gain knowledge on how and when to use tools without being intimidated or overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>Keeping track of your results and progress, you gain insight into your abilities and are motivated to keep improving your knowledge and experience.</p>

        <blockquote>Hands-on experience and real-life usage</blockquote>

        <h3>Simulate real life scenarios</h3>
        <p>Applicable training goes beyond theory and textbooks. It’s based on real world situations and everyday practice. It provides more value to organisations by giving participants practical, immediately applicable skills and tools, through great trainers with hands-on, professional experience.</p>
        <p>By simulating real life production setups and scenarios and replay them repeatedly, you build the skills and confidence needed to solve problems in the heat of the moment.</p>
        <p>Find your own solutions to the problems, and gain hands-on experience along the way.</p>
        <p>Scenarios can be tailored to your own situation, allowing you to capture and train for possible failure scenarios.</p>

    <section id="sharing">
      <div class="content">
        <h1>Learn from each other</h1>
        <p>See how you measure up to the rest of the community and your colleagues, by comparing results and solutions. Discuss solutions with your peers, and derive best practices together. Contribute challenges to the community and collectively learn from your experiences.</p>

        <h2>T-Shaped profiles</h2>
        <p>Instead of a one-off investment in a specific training, organizations see the value of enriching their company culture through an individual employee's ongoing professional development.</p>
        <p>It's no longer good enough for organizations to trawl out off-the-shelf training to maximize performance. That’s why we see a growing trend and high demand for customized training and adaptive learning. Adaptive learning uses technology to modify materials according to the unique needs of each learner. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, the overall trend we see across all industries is that when organizations embrace and nurture a company-wide love of learning, everybody profits.</p>
